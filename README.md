### Project Description: Library Management System

**Overview:**
The Library Management System is a web-based application designed to automate the library operations. It facilitates the interaction between librarians (admins) and library patrons (students), providing a seamless experience for managing books, fines, and borrowing activities.

**User Profiles:**
1. **Admin:**
   - Responsible for managing the entire library system.
   - Can add new books to the system.
   - Remove books from the library inventory.
   - Manage fines imposed on students who return books after the due date.

2. **Student:**
   - Can browse available books in the library.
   - Search for books using keywords.
   - Reserve books that are available.
   - View borrowed books and their due dates.
   - Check any pending fines associated with late returns.

**Authentication and Security:**
- User authentication is implemented using JavaScript for client-side validation and PHP for server-side validation.
- Passwords must meet specific criteria: include at least one special character, one number, one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and have a minimum length of 9 characters.

**Functionality:**
- **Admin Functions:**
  - **Login:** Authenticate using username and password.
  - **Add Books:** Input book details such as title, author, ISBN, etc., and add them to the library inventory.
  - **Remove Books:** Remove books from the library system.
  - **Manage Fines:** View fines accrued by students and mark fines as paid after payment.

- **Student Functions:**
  - **Login:** Authenticate using username and password.
  - **Browse Books:** View the list of available books in the library.
  - **Search Books:** Search for books using keywords such as title, author, or genre.
  - **Reserve Books:** Reserve books that are currently available.
  - **View Borrowed Books:** See the list of books borrowed and their respective due dates.
  - **Check Fines:** View any fines accrued due to late returns.

**Fines Management:**
- Fines can only be managed (marked as paid) by the admin after a student has paid the fine amount.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Backend:** PHP for server-side scripting.
- **Database:** MySQL for storing book information, user data, and transaction records.
- **Web Server:** XAMPP for local development and testing.
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for user interface design and responsiveness.

**Conclusion:**
The Library Management System aims to streamline library operations, enhancing the efficiency of book management, borrowing, and fine handling processes. It ensures secure authentication and authorization for both administrators and students, utilizing robust technologies for seamless functionality and user experience.
